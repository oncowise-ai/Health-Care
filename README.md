## About

The purpose of this repository is to provide a centralized place for open-source medical AI/ML models and datasets. By fostering collaboration between the medical and data science communities, we aim to accelerate the development of AI tools that can help improve diagnostics, treatment planning, and other medical tasks.

Our vision is to create a shared resource for medical practitioners and machine learning experts, making the latest AI techniques accessible to all, and helping drive innovation in the healthcare sector.

## Features

- **Pretrained Models:** Access a collection of pretrained AI models for medical applications (e.g., image analysis, disease prediction, personalized treatment).
- **Curated Datasets:** Explore publicly available datasets for healthcare, including imaging, clinical data, and genomic datasets.
- **Tutorials & Documentation:** Step-by-step guides and tutorials for using models, preprocessing datasets, and training custom models.
- **Community Contributions:** Open for contributions from the global AI and medical community. Add your models, datasets, or research.
