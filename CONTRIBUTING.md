### 7. Address Feedback

The repository maintainers may request changes or additional information regarding your PR. Be sure to engage in the conversation and make necessary updates.

## Code Style

To maintain a high standard of code quality, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Python Code**:
  - Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code style.
  - Use meaningful variable names, add comments, and maintain a consistent structure.
  - Document functions and classes using [docstrings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/).
  - Use type hints where possible for better readability.
  
- **Testing**:
  - Add or update tests for any new functionality you introduce.
  - Use unit tests to ensure your code is correct and maintainable.

- **Data Formats**:
  - Provide metadata, a description, and licensing information for each dataset.
  - Ensure datasets are well-organized and include clear instructions for usage.

## Datasets Guidelines

If you’re contributing a new dataset, please follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the dataset complies with all legal requirements, including HIPAA or GDPR (for personal data).
2. Include a `README.md` in the dataset folder with:
   - Dataset description (source, type of data, number of records/images).
   - Instructions for loading and preprocessing the data.
   - Licensing and citation information.
3. Provide a sample code to demonstrate how to load and use the dataset.
4. Validate that the dataset is appropriately formatted and consistent.

## Reporting Bugs

If you encounter a bug, please report it by opening an issue on GitHub. Include the following information:

- **Description**: Clearly describe the issue and what you were doing when it occurred.
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Provide a step-by-step guide to help us recreate the bug.
- **Expected Behavior**: Describe what you expected to happen.
- **Actual Behavior**: Describe what actually happened.
- **Screenshots/Logs**: Attach any relevant logs, screenshots, or error messages.

## Feature Requests
